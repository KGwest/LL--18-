# 🍽️ WD: LL18 – Chef's Twist API Mashup Project
This project is part of **LiveLab 18**, where you'll build a creative recipe app that combines the **MealDB API** with **OpenAI's Chat Completions API**. The app fetches random recipes and allows users to remix them based on selected themes, save favorites, and revisit them later.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch random recipes from the MealDB API
- Remix recipes using OpenAI's Chat Completions API with user-selected themes
- Save favorite recipes to local storage
- Display a list of saved recipes and allow users to delete or reload them

To get started, launch a Codespace or create a fork of this repository.
