## Step 1: Create a secrets.js file
Create a new `secrets.js` file to store my OpenAI API key. `secrets.js` is already linked to `index.html`. Do not use `import` or `export` statements.

## Step 2: Remix a Recipe
Create a function that takes the raw JSON data from the currently displayed random MealDB recipe on the page, along with the remix theme selected by the user, and sends them directly to OpenAI's chat completions API. The API should respond with a short, fun, creative, and totally doable remix of the recipe, highlighting any changed ingredients or cooking instructions. Display the AI's remixed recipe on the page.

Set up the "Remix" button so that when clicked, the app runs this remix function.

## Step 3: Add a Loading Message
When the user clicks the Remix button and is waiting for the AI to respond, display a fun and friendly loading message to let them know the remix is being prepared. Replace this message with the actual remixed recipe once the AI responds.  

## Step 4: Friendly Error Handling
<!-- If generated code does not include error handling -->
If something goes wrong when trying to get a remix from the AI (for example, if the request fails), show a simple, friendly message on the page letting the user know something went wrong, rather than showing nothing or an error.

## Step 5: Save and Display Favorite Recipes
Add a "Save Recipe" button below the main recipe instructions. When clicked, save the name of the currently displayed random recipe from MealDB to local storage. Show a list of these saved recipe names above the main recipe display.

Load this list automatically when the page refreshes, and only show the saved recipes container if there are recipe names saved.

## Step 6: Delete Saved Recipes
For each recipe name in the saved recipes list, add a "Delete" button so users can remove recipes from local storage. 

## Step 7: Load Saved Recipes
Make each saved recipe name clickable. When clicked, fetch the complete recipe details for that name from MealDB and display the full recipe on the page.
